Your decision to use an in-memory database would depend on your use case. In-memory databases are great for high-volume data access where a data loss would be acceptable.

The information about the products is crucial and should be kept on a persisted storage, but the information in the shopping cart could potentially be kept in an in-memory database for quicker access.
